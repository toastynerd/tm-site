# Building This Blog

I wanted to document the process of building this blog, as it's been an interesting journey combining modern web technologies with AI assistance. Here's a look at how it came together.

## The Tech Stack

The blog is built with:
- **Next.js 15** - For the core framework and server-side rendering
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling and responsive design
- **MDX** - For writing blog posts in Markdown with React components
- **highlight.js** - For syntax highlighting in code blocks

## Development Process

### Initial Setup
The project started with a basic Next.js setup using the App Router. I added Tailwind CSS for styling and set up the basic layout with dark mode support using `next-themes`.

### Blog Post System
For the blog posts, I implemented a markdown-based system that:
1. Stores posts as `.md` files in the `src/content/blog` directory
2. Uses `gray-matter` to parse frontmatter metadata
3. Processes markdown with remark and rehype plugins
4. Renders content with proper styling and syntax highlighting

### Syntax Highlighting Journey
One of the more interesting challenges was implementing syntax highlighting for code blocks. The process went through several iterations:

1. Started with Prism.js and client-side highlighting
2. Attempted server-side rendering with `rehype-prism-plus`
3. Finally settled on `highlight.js` with `rehype-highlight` for a simpler, more reliable solution

The current implementation provides:
- Server-side syntax highlighting
- Support for multiple programming languages
- A clean, GitHub-like dark theme
- No client-side JavaScript required for highlighting

## AI Assistance

This blog was developed with the assistance of Claude 3 Sonnet, an AI language model. The AI helped with:
- Setting up the initial project structure
- Implementing the markdown processing pipeline
- Debugging syntax highlighting issues
- Generating test content and example code
- Writing documentation

All AI-generated content (including this post) is marked with appropriate attribution in the frontmatter.

## Next Steps

Future improvements planned for the blog include:
- Adding tags and categories for posts
- Implementing a search feature
- Adding an RSS feed
- Improving SEO
- Adding comments functionality
- Creating more interactive components

## Conclusion

Building this blog has been a great learning experience in combining modern web technologies. The use of AI assistance helped streamline the development process while maintaining code quality and documentation standards.

The source code for this blog is available on GitHub, and I plan to continue improving it as I write more content and add new features.
